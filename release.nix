    longDescription = ''
    GNU ccd2cue is a CCD sheet to CUE sheet converter.  It supports the
    full extent of CUE sheet format expressiveness, including mixed-mode
    discs and CD-Text meta-data.  It plays an important role for those who
    need to use optical disc data which is only available in the
    proprietary sheet format CCD, but don't want to surrender their
    freedom.  It fills an important gap in the free software world because
    before its conception it was impossible to use complex forms of
    optical disc data laid out by CCD sheets in a whole/holy free
    operating system.

    The GNU ccd2cue documentation is also intended to be a reference
    documentation for both sheet format specifications.  That way we can
    reverse engineer the secret CCD sheet proprietary format only once and
    then make the information available for developers in order to benefit
    all free software users that want their software to be interoperable.
    The CUE sheet format is not a secret, but with this package we take
    the opportunity to ensure that its specification is available under a
    free documentation license for the sake of the whole free software
    community.
